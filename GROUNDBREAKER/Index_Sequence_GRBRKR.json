Despite Liam's deep-seated fear of re-capture and reluctance to trust, Ryo's persistent (and forceful) invitation leads him to a warm, if chaotic, dinner with Minato and Anj, a family friend. The genuine kindness and lively banter of his hosts offer Liam a rare moment of peace, even as Anj's probing questions about his origins make him anxious. Overcoming Ryo's initial disapproval, Minato offers Liam a place to stay for the night, providing the exhausted escapee with a safe, temporary haven—a stark contrast to his past torment.",
